## 1. Set Dash and Gap as Percentage

This utility helps you create percentage donuts with border dash and gap.

The way it works is by calculating the circumference of the circle from its radius using `2 * Math.PI * radius` and then setting the dash proportionately.

To use, just run the _Set Dash and Gap as Percentage_ command from the PFAS Tools plugin menu, and enter your desired percentage when prompted.
